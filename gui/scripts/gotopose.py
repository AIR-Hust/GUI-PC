#Usually an autonomous mobile robot is tasked to reach a goal location. In order to do so, it must have some informations and combine it: have a map of the environment it is in, perceive its sorroundings, localize itself and plan its movements

# TurtleBot must have minimal.launch & amcl_demo.launch
# running prior to starting this script
# For simulation: launch gazebo world & amcl_demo prior to run this script

#import library and message file

#The ROS navigation stack is based on ROS Actions: indeed Actions are the best choice for cases when a node wants to send a request to another node and will receive a response after a relatively long time. To avoid leaving the user wondering what’s happening and if all is going as desired, Actions implement a feedback mechanism, which let the user receive information every now and then. Actions are Client-Server-based: the actionlib library provides the tools and interface to set up an Action Server to execute the requested goals sent by the Client. The main elements of an action mechanisms are: goal, result, and feedback. Each one of them is specified by a ROS Message type, contained in an action definition file, with “.action” extension.

#The move_base ROS Node, is a major component of the navigation stack which allows to configure, run and interact with the latter. The move_base node implements a SimpleActionServer, an action server with a single goal policy, taking in goals of geometry_msgs/PoseStamped message type. To communicate with this node, the SimpleActionClient interface is used. The move_base node tries to achieve a desired pose by combining a global and a local motion planners to accomplish a navigation task which includes obstacle avoidance.
